This is the checklist that I (Jérôme) use when delivering a workshop.

- [ ] Create branch + `_redirects` + push to GitHub + Netlify setup
- [ ] Add branch to index.html
- [ ] Update the slides that says which versions we are using
- [ ] Update the version of Compose and Machine in settings
- [ ] Create chatroom
- [ ] Set chatroom in YML and deploy
- [ ] Put chat room in index.html
- [ ] Walk the room to count seats, check power supplies, lectern, A/V setup
- [ ] How many VMs do we need?
- [ ] Provision VMs
- [ ] Print cards
- [ ] Cut cards
- [ ] Last minute merge from master
- [ ] Check that all looks good
- [ ] DELIVER!
- [ ] Shutdown VMs
- [ ] Update index.html to remove chat link and move session to past things
