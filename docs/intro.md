<!--
Reminder, when updating the agenda: when people are told to show
up at 9am, they usually trickle in until 9:30am (except for paid
training sessions). If you're not sure that people will be there
on time, it's a good idea to have a breakfast with the attendees
at e.g. 9am, and start at 9:30.

## A brief introduction

- This was initially written to support in-person,
  instructor-led workshops and tutorials

- You can also follow along on your own, at your own pace

- We included as much information as possible in these slides

- We recommend having a mentor to help you ...

- ... Or be comfortable spending some time reading the Docker
 [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) ...

- ... And looking for answers in the [Docker forums](forums.docker.com),
  [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/docker),
  and other outlets

## Hands on, you shall practice

- Nobody ever became a Jedi by spending their lives reading Wookiepedia

- Likewise, it will take more than merely *reading* these slides
  to make you an expert

- These slides include *tons* of exercises

- They assume that you have access to a cluster of Docker nodes

- If you are attending a workshop or tutorial:
  <br/>you will be given specific instructions to access your cluster

- If you are doing this on your own:
  <br/>you can use
  [Play-With-Docker](http://www.play-with-docker.com/) and
  read [these instructions](https://github.com/jpetazzo/orchestration-workshop#using-play-with-docker) for extra
  details
