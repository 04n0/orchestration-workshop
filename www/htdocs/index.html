# Pre-requirements

- Computer with network connection and SSH client

  - on Linux, OS X, FreeBSD... you are probably all set

  - on Windows, get [putty](http://www.putty.org/),
  [Git BASH](https://msysgit.github.io/), or
  [MobaXterm](http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/)

- Basic Docker knowledge
  <br/>(but that's OK if you're not a Docker expert!)

---

## Nice-to-haves

- [GitHub](https://github.com/join) account
  <br/>(if you want to fork the repo; also used to join Gitter)

- [Gitter](https://gitter.im/) account
  <br/>(to join the conversation during the workshop)

- [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) account
  <br/>(it's one way to distribute images on your Swarm cluster)

---

## Hands-on sections

- The whole workshop is hands-on

- I will show Docker in action

- I invite you to reproduce what I do

- All hands-on sections are clearly identified, like the gray rectangle below

.exercise[

- This is the stuff you're supposed to do!
- Go to [container.training](http://container.training/) to view these slides
- Join the chat room on
  [Gitter](http://container.training/chat)

]

---

# VM environment

- Each person gets 5 private VMs (not shared with anybody else)
- They'll be up until tomorrow
- You have a little card with login+password+IP addresses
- You can automatically SSH from one VM to another

.exercise[

<!--
```bash
for N in $(seq 1 5); do
  ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no node$N true
done
for N in $(seq 1 5); do
  (.
  docker-machine rm -f node$N
  ssh node$N "docker ps -aq | xargs -r docker rm -f"
  ssh node$N sudo rm -f /etc/systemd/system/docker.service
  ssh node$N sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  echo Restarting node$N.
  ssh node$N sudo systemctl restart docker
  echo Restarted node$N.
  ) &
done
wait
```
-->

- Log into the first VM (`node1`)
- Check that you can SSH (without password) to `node2`:
  ```bash
  ssh node2
  ```
- Type `exit` or `^D` to come back to node1

<!--
```meta
^D
```
-->

]

---

## We will (mostly) interact with node1 only

- Unless instructed, **all commands must be run from the first VM, `node1`**

- We will only checkout/copy the code on `node1`

- When we will use the other nodes, we will do it mostly through the Docker API

- We will use SSH only for a few "out of band" operations (mass-removing containers...)

---

## Terminals

Once in a while, the instructions will say:
<br/>"Open a new terminal."

There are multiple ways to do this:

- create a new window or tab on your machine, and SSH into the VM;

- use screen or tmux on the VM and open a new window from there.

You are welcome to use the method that you feel the most comfortable with.

---

## Tmux cheatsheet

- Ctrl-b c ‚Üí creates a new window
- Ctrl-b n ‚Üí go to next window
- Ctrl-b p ‚Üí go to previous window
- Ctrl-b " ‚Üí split window top/bottom
- Ctrl-b % ‚Üí split window left/right
- Ctrl-b Alt-1 ‚Üí rearrange windows in columns
- Ctrl-b Alt-2 ‚Üí rearrange windows in rows
- Ctrl-b arrows ‚Üí navigate to other windows
- Ctrl-b d ‚Üí detach session
- tmux attach ‚Üí reattach to session

---

## Brand new versions!

- Engine 1.12
- Compose 1.7
- Swarm 1.2
- Machine 0.6

.exercise[

- Check all installed versions:
  ```bash
  docker version
  docker-compose -v
  docker run --rm swarm -version
  docker-machine -v
  ```

]

---

## Why are we not using the latest version of Machine?

- The latest version of Machine is 0.7

- The way it deploys Swarm is different from 0.6

- This causes a regression in the strategy that we will use later

- More details later!

---

# Our sample application

- Visit the GitHub repository with all the materials of this workshop:
  <br/>https://github.com/jpetazzo/orchestration-workshop

- The application is in the [dockercoins](
  https://github.com/jpetazzo/orchestration-workshop/tree/master/dockercoins)
  subdirectory

- Let's look at the general layout of the source code:
  
  there is a Compose file [docker-compose.yml](
  https://github.com/jpetazzo/orchestration-workshop/blob/master/dockercoins/docker-compose.yml) ...

  ... and 4 other services, each in its own directory:

  - `rng` = web service generating random bytes
  - `hasher` = web service computing hash of POSTed data
  - `worker` = background process using `rng` and `hasher`
  - `webui` = web interface to watch progress

---

## What's this application?

---

class: pic

![DockerCoins logo](dockercoins.png)

(DockerCoins logo courtesy of @jonasrosland. Thanks!)

---

## What's this application?

- It is a DockerCoin miner! üí∞üê≥üì¶üö¢

- No, you can't buy coffee with DockerCoins

- How DockerCoins works:

  - `worker` asks to `rng` to give it random bytes
  - `worker` feeds those random bytes into `hasher`
  - each hash starting with `0` is a DockerCoin
  - DockerCoins are stored in `redis`
  - `redis` is also updated every second to track speed
  - you can see the progress with the `webui`

---

## Getting the application source code

- We will clone the GitHub repository

- The repository also contains scripts and tools that we will use through the workshop

.exercise[

<!--
```bash
[ -d orchestration-workshop ] && mv orchestration-workshop orchestration-workshop.$$
```
-->

- Clone the repository on `node1`:
  ```bash
  git clone git://github.com/jpetazzo/orchestration-workshop
  ```

]

(You can also fork the repository on GitHub and clone your fork if you prefer that.)

---

# Running the application

Without further ado, let's start our application.

.exercise[

- Go to the `dockercoins` directory, in the cloned repo:
  ```bash
  cd ~/orchestration-workshop/dockercoins
  ```

- Use Compose to build and run all containers:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up
  ```

]

Compose tells Docker to build all container images (pulling
the corresponding base images), then starts all containers,
and displays aggregated logs.

---

## Lots of logs

- The application continuously generates logs

- We can see the `worker` service making requests to `rng` and `hasher`

- Let's put that in the background

.exercise[

- Stop the application by hitting `^C`

<!--
```meta
^C
```
-->

]

- `^C` stops all containers by sending them the `TERM` signal

- Some containers exit immediately, others take longer
  <br/>(because they don't handle `SIGTERM` and end up being killed after a 10s timeout)

---

## Restarting in the background

- Many flags and commands of Compose are modeled after those of `docker`

.exercise[

- Start the app in the background with the `-d` option:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d
  ```

- Check that our app is running with the `ps` command:
  ```bash
  docker-compose ps
  ```

]

`docker-compose ps` also shows the ports exposed by the application.

---

## Connecting to the web UI

- The `webui` container exposes a web dashboard; let's view it

.exercise[

- Open http://[yourVMaddr]:8000/ (from a browser)

]

- The app actually has a constant, steady speed (3.33 coins/second)

- The speed seems not-so-steady because:

  - the worker doesn't update the counter after every loop, but up to once per second

  - the speed is computed by the browser, checking the counter about once per second

  - between two consecutive updates, the counter will increase either by 4, or by 0

---

## Viewing logs

- The `docker-compose logs` command works like `docker logs`

.exercise[

- View all logs since container creation and exit when done:
  ```bash
  docker-compose logs
  ```

- Stream container logs, starting at the last 10 lines for each container:
  ```bash
  docker-compose logs --tail 10 --follow
  ```

<!--
```meta
^C
```
-->

]

Tip: use `^S` and `^Q` to pause/resume log output.

---

## Upgrading from Compose 1.6

.warning[The `logs` command has changed between Compose 1.6 and 1.7!]

- Up to 1.6

  - `docker-compose logs` is the equivalent of `logs --follow`

  - `docker-compose logs` must be restarted if containers are added

- Since 1.7

  - `--follow` must be specified explicitly

  - new containers are automatically picked up by `docker-compose logs`

---

## Testing services in isolation

- We will stop the `worker` service, and test `rng` and `hasher` alone

.exercise[

- Stop the `worker` service:
  ```bash
  docker-compose stop worker
  ```

- Look at the logs of `rng` and `hasher`:
  ```bash
  docker-compose logs --tail 10 --follow
  ```

<!--
```meta
^Z
```
-->

]

We will let Compose stream the logs,
and open a new terminal.

---

## Compose file location

- What happens if you try to run Compose in `$HOME`?

--

- Compose complains that it cannot find `docker-compose.yml`

- You need to go to the directory containing `docker-compose.yml`
  <br/>...or use the `-f` option to give the path to the Compose file
  <br/>...or set the `COMPOSE_FILE` environment variable

.exercise[

- Go to the application directory:
  ```bash
  cd ~/orchestration-workshop/dockercoins
  ```

]

---

## Locating port numbers for `rng` and `hasher`

- We can see the port mapping for our services with:
  ```bash
  docker-compose ps
  ```

- Both services run on port 80 *in their respective container*

- On the Docker host, they are mapped to ports 8001 and 8002

- They are not exposed on port 80, because the Docker host has only one port 80

- The mapping is done in `docker-compose.yml`

---

# Container port mapping

- `node1`, the Docker host, has only one port 80

- If we give the one and only port 80 to the first
  container who asks for it, we are in trouble when
  another container needs it

- Default behavior: containers are not "exposed"
  <br/>(only reachable by the Docker host and other containers,
  through their private address)

- Container network services can be exposed:

  - statically (you decide which host port to use)

  - dynamically (Docker allocates a host port)

---

## Declaring port mapping

- Directly with the Docker Engine:
  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 8000:80 nginx
  docker run -d -p 80 nginx
  docker run -d -P nginx
  ```

- With Docker Compose, in the `docker-compose.yml` file:
  ```yaml
    rng:
      ‚Ä¶
      ports:
        - "8001:80"
  ```

‚Üí port 8001 *on the host* maps to
port 80 *in the container*

---

## Testing the `rng` service

Let's get random bytes of data!

.exercise[

- Check that the service is alive:
  <br/>`curl localhost:8001`

- Get 10 bytes of random data:
  <br/>`curl localhost:8001/10`

]

If the binary data output messed up your terminal, fix it with `reset`.

---

## Testing the `hasher` service

.exercise[

- Check that the `hasher` service is alive:
  ```bash
  curl localhost:8002
  ```

- Posting binary data requires some extra flags:

  ```bash
    curl -H "Content-type: application/octet-stream" \
      --data-binary hello localhost:8002
  ```

]

---

## Verifying the computed hash

- This web service is essentially implementing `sha256sum` over HTTP

.exercise[

- Check that `sha256sum` yields the same result:
  ```bash
  echo -n hello | sha256sum
  ```

]

- We specify `-n` to prevent `echo` from adding a trailing `\n`
  <br/>(which would change the SHA digest)

---

## Checking logs

- The tests that we made should show up in the first window
  <br/>(where `docker-compose logs` is still running)

- We can now restart the `worker` service

.exercise[

- Start the `worker` container:
  ```bash
  docker-compose start worker
  ```

]

In the web UI, the graph should go up again.

How can we get that graph to go further up?

---


## Looking at resource usage

- Let's look at CPU, memory, and I/O usage

.exercise[

- run `top` to see CPU and memory usage (you should see idle cycles)

- run `vmstat 3` to see I/O usage (si/so/bi/bo)
  <br/>(the 4 numbers should be almost zero, except `bo` for logging)

]

We have available resources.

- Why?
- How can we use them?

---

## Scaling workers on a single node

- Docker Compose supports scaling.red[*]
- Let's scale `worker` and see what happens!

.exercise[

- Start 9 more `worker` containers:
  ```bash
  docker-compose scale worker=10
  ```

- Check the aggregated logs of those containers

- See the impact on CPU load (with top/htop), and on compute speed (with web UI)

<!--
```bash
sleep 5
killall docker-compose
```
-->

]

.red[*]With some limitations, as we'll see later.

---

# Identifying bottlenecks

- You should have seen a 3x speed bump (not 10x)

- Adding workers didn't result in linear improvement

- *Something else* is slowing us down

--

- ... But what?

--

- The code doesn't have instrumentation

- Let's use state-of-the-art HTTP performance analysis!
  <br/>(i.e. good old tools like `ab`, `httping`...)

---

## Measuring latency under load

We will use `httping`.

.exercise[

- Check the latency of `rng`:
  ```bash
  httping -c 10 localhost:8001
  ```

- Check the latency of `hasher`:
  ```bash
  httping -c 10 localhost:8002
  ```

]

`rng` has a much higher latency than `hasher`.

---

## Benchmarking in isolation

We will now use `ab`.

.exercise[

- Stop the `worker` containers:
  ```bash
  docker-compose kill worker
  ```

]

---

## Benchmarking `rng`

We will send 50 requests, but with various levels of concurrency.

.exercise[

- Send 50 requests, with a single sequential client:
  ```bash
  ab -c 1 -n 50 localhost:8001/10
  ```

- Send 50 requests, with ten parallel clients:
  ```bash
  ab -c 10 -n 50 localhost:8001/10
  ```

]

---

## Benchmark results for `rng`

- In both cases, the benchmark takes ~5 seconds to complete

- When serving requests sequentially, they each take 100ms

- In the parallel scenario, the latency increased dramatically:

  - one request is served in 100ms
  - another is served in 200ms
  - another is served in 300ms
  - ...
  - another is served in 1000ms

- What about `hasher`?

---

## Benchmarking `hasher`

We will do the same tests for `hasher`.

The command is slightly more complex, since we need to post random data.

First, we need to put the POST payload in a temporary file.

.exercise[

- Generate 10 bytes of random data:
  ```bash
  curl localhost:8001/10 >/tmp/random
  ```

]

---

## Benchmarking `hasher`

Once again, we will send 50 requests, with different levels of concurrency.

.exercise[

- Send 50 requests with a sequential client:
  ```bash
    ab -c 1 -n 50 -T application/octet-stream \
       -p /tmp/random localhost:8002/
  ```

- Send 50 requests with 10 parallel clients:
  ```bash
    ab -c 10 -n 50 -T application/octet-stream \
       -p /tmp/random localhost:8002/
  ```

]

---

## Benchmark results for `hasher`

- The sequential benchmarks takes ~5 seconds to complete

- The parallel benchmark takes less than 1 second to complete

- In both cases, each request takes a bit more than 100ms to complete

- Requests are a bit slower in the parallel benchmark

- It looks like `hasher` is better equiped to deal with concurrency than `rng`

---

class: title

Why?

---

## Why does everything take (at least) 100ms?

--

`rng` code:

![RNG code screenshot](delay-rng.png)

--

`hasher` code:

![HASHER code screenshot](delay-hasher.png)

---

class: title

But ...

WHY?!?

---

## Why did we sprinkle this sample app with sleeps?

- Deterministic performance
  <br/>(regardless of instance speed, CPUs, I/O...)

--

- Actual code sleeps all the time anyway

--

- When your code makes a remote API call:

  - it sends a request;

  - it sleeps until it gets the response;

  - it processes the response.

---

## Why do `rng` and `hasher` behave differently?

![Equations on a blackboard](equations.png)

--

(Synchronous vs. asynchronous event processing)

---

## How to make `rng` go faster

- Obvious solution: comment out the `sleep` instruction

--

- Unfortunately, in the real world, network latency exists

--

- More realistic solution: use an asynchronous framework
  <br/>(e.g. use gunicorn with gevent)

--

- New rule: we can't change the code!

--

- Solution: scale out `rng`
  <br/>(dispatch `rng` requests on multiple instances)

---

# Scaling HTTP on a single node

- We could try to scale with Compose:

  ```bash
  docker-compose scale rng=3
  ```

- Since Engine 1.11, we get round-robin DNS records

  (i.e. resolving `rng` will yield the IP addresses of all 3 containers)

- But many (most) resolvers will sort records

- So we would get 3 instances ...

- ... But only one would serve traffic

---

## The plan

<!--
- Stop the `rng` service first
-->

- Create multiple identical `rng` containers

- Put a load balancer in front of them

- Point other services to the load balancer

???

## Stopping `rng`

- That's the easy part!

.exercise[

- Use `docker-compose` to stop `rng`:

  ```bash
  docker-compose stop rng
  ```

]

Note: we do this first because we are about to remove
`rng` from the Docker Compose file.

If we don't stop
`rng` now, it will remain up and running, with Compose
being unaware of its existence!

---

## Scaling `rng`

.exercise[

- Replace the `rng` service with multiple copies of it:

  ```yaml
    rng1:
      build: rng

    rng2:
      build: rng

    rng3:
      build: rng
  ```

]

That's all!

Shortcut: `docker-compose.yml-scaled-rng`

---

## Introduction to `jpetazzo/hamba`

- General purpose load balancer and traffic director

- [Source code is available on GitHub](
  https://github.com/jpetazzo/hamba)

- [Public image is available on the Docker Hub](
  https://hub.docker.com/r/jpetazzo/hamba/)

- Generates a configuration file for HAProxy, then starts HAProxy

- Parameters are provided on the command line; for instance:
  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 80 jpetazzo/hamba 80 www1:1234 www2:2345
  docker run -d -p 80 jpetazzo/hamba 80 www1 1234 www2 2345
  ```
  Those two commands do the same thing: they start a load balancer
  listening on port 80, and balancing traffic across www1:1234 and www2:2345

---

# Put a load balancer on it

Let's add our load balancer to the Compose file.

.exercise[

- Add the following section to the Compose file:

  ```yaml
  rng:
      image: jpetazzo/hamba
      links:
        - rng1
        - rng2
        - rng3
      command: 80 rng1 80 rng2 80 rng3 80
      ports:
        - "8001:80"
  ```

<!--
```edit
cp docker-compose.yml-scaled-rng docker-compose.yml
```
-->

]

Shortcut: `docker-compose.yml-scaled-rng`

---

## Start the whole stack

.exercise[

- Start the new services:
  <br/>`docker-compose up -d`

- Check worker logs:
  <br/>`docker-compose logs worker`

- Check load balancer logs:
  <br/>`docker-compose logs rng`

]

<!--
If you get errors about port 8001, make sure that
`rng` was stopped correctly and try again.
-->

---

## Results

- Check the latency of `rng`
  <br/>(it should have improved significantly!)

- Check the application performance in the web UI
  <br/>(it should improve if you have enough workers)

*Note: if `worker` was scaled when you did `docker-compose up`,
it probably took a while, because `worker` doesn't handle
signals properly and Docker patiently waits 10 seconds for
each `worker` instance to terminate. This would be much
faster for a well-behaved application.*

---

## The good, the bad, the ugly

--

- The good

  We scaled a service, added a load balancer - without changing a single line of code.

--

- The bad

  We manually copy-pasted sections in `docker-compose.yml`.

  Improvement: write scripts to transform the YAML file.

--

- The ugly

  If we scale up/down, we have to restart everything.

  Improvement: reconfigure the load balancer dynamically.

---

## Cleaning up

- Before moving forward, let's clean up all those containers

.exercise[

- Use the `down` command to stop and remove containers:
  ```bash
  docker-compose down
  ```

]

---

# Connecting to containers on other hosts

- So far, our whole stack is on a single machine

- We want to scale out (across multiple nodes)

- We will deploy the same stack multiple times

- But we want every stack to use the same Redis
  <br/>(in other words: Redis is our only *stateful* service here)

--

- And remember: we're not allowed to change the code!

  - the code connects to host `redis`
  - `redis` must resolve to the address of our Redis service
  - the Redis service must listen on the default port (6379)

???

## Using host name injection to abstract service dependencies

- It is possible to add host entries to a container

- With the CLI:

  ```bash
  docker run --add-host redis:192.168.1.2 myservice...
  ```

- In a Compose file:

  ```yaml
  myservice:
    image: myservice
    extra_host:
      redis: 192.168.1.2
  ```

- Docker exposes a DNS server to the container,
  <br/>with a private view where `redis` resolves to `192.168.1.2`
  (Before Engine 1.10, it created entries in `/etc/hosts`)

???

## The plan

- Deploy our Redis service separately

  - use the same `redis` image

  - make sure that Redis server port (6379) is publicly accessible,
    using port 6379 on the Docker host

- Update our Docker Compose YAML file

  - remove the `redis` section

  - in the `links` section, remove `redis`

  - instead, put a `redis` entry in `extra_hosts`

Note: the code stays on the first node!
<br/>(We do not need to copy the code to the other nodes.)

???

## Making Redis available on its default port

There are two strategies.

- `docker run -p 6379:6379 redis`

  - the container has its own, isolated network stack
  - Docker creates a port mapping rule through iptables
  - slight performance overhead
  - port number is explicit (visible through Docker API)

- `docker run --net host redis`

  - the container uses the network stack of the host
  - when it binds to 6379/tcp, that's 6379/tcp on the host
  - allows raw speed (no overhead due to iptables/bridge)
  - port number is not visible through Docker API

Choose wisely!

???

##¬†Deploy Redis

.exercise[

- Start a new redis container, mapping port 6379 to 6379:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis
  ```

- Check that it's running with `docker ps`

- Note the IP address of this Docker host

- Try to connect to it (from anywhere):

  ```bash
  curl node1:6379
  ```

]

The `ERR` messages are normal: Redis speaks Redis, not HTTP.

???

## Update `docker-compose.yml` (1/3)

.exercise[

- Comment out `redis`:

  ```yaml
  #redis:
  #    image: redis
  ```

]

???

## Update `docker-compose.yml` (2/3)

.exercise[

- Update `worker`:

  ```yaml
  worker:
    build: worker
    extra_hosts:
      redis: AA.BB.CC.DD
    links:
      - rng
      - hasher
  ```

]

Replace `AA.BB.CC.DD` with the IP address noted earlier.

Shortcut: `docker-compose.yml-extra-hosts`
<br/>(But you still have to replace `AA.BB.CC.DD`!)

???

## Update `docker-compose.yml` (3/3)

.exercise[

- Update `webui`:

  ```yaml
  webui:
    build: webui
    extra_hosts:
      redis: AA.BB.CC.DD
    ports:
      - "8000:80"
    volumes:
      - "./webui/files/:/files/"
  ```

]

(Replace `AA.BB.CC.DD` with the IP address noted earlier)

???

## Start the stack on the first machine

- Nothing special to do here

- Just bring up the application like we did before

.exercise[

- `docker-compose up -d`

]

- Check in the web browser that it's running correctly

???

## Start the stack on another machine

- We will set the `DOCKER_HOST` variable

- `docker-compose` will detect and use it

- Our Docker hosts are listening on port 55555

.exercise[

- Set the environment variable:
  <br/>`export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://node2:55555`

- Start the stack:
  <br/>`docker-compose up -d`

- Check that it's running:
  <br/>`docker-compose ps`

]

???

## Scale!

.exercise[

- Keep an eye on the web UI

- Create 20 workers on both nodes:
  ```bash
  for NODE in node1 node2; do
    export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://$NODE:55555
    docker-compose scale worker=20
  done
  ```

]

Note: of course, if we wanted, we could run on all five nodes.

???

## Cleanup

- Let's remove what we did

.exercise[

- You can use the following scriptlet:

  ```bash
  for N in $(seq 1 5); do
    export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://node$N:55555
    docker ps -qa | xargs docker rm -f
  done
  unset DOCKER_HOST
  ```

]

---

# Using custom DNS mapping

- We could setup a Redis server on its default port

- And add a DNS entry mapping `redis` to this server

.exercise[

- See what happens if we run:
  ```bash
  docker run --add-host redis:1.2.3.4 alpine ping redis
  ```

<!--
```meta
^C
```
-->

]

There is a Compose file option for that: `extra_hosts`.

---

# Abstracting remote services with ambassadors

- What if we can't/won't run Redis on its default port?

- What if we want to be able to move it easily?

--

- We will use an ambassador

- Redis will be started independently of our stack

- It will run at an arbitrary location (host+port)

- In our stack, we replace `redis` with an ambassador

- The ambassador will connect to Redis

- The ambassador will "act as" Redis in the stack

---

## Start redis

- Start a standalone Redis container

- Let Docker expose it on a random port

.exercise[

- Run redis with a random public port:
  <br/>`docker run -d -P --name myredis redis`

- Check which port was allocated:
  <br/>`docker port myredis 6379`

]

- Note the IP address of the machine, and this port

---

## Update `docker-compose.yml`

.exercise[

<!-- Following line to be commented out if we skip extra_hosts section -->
<!--
- Restore `links` as they were before in `webui` and `worker`
-->
<!-- -->

- Replace `redis` with an ambassador using `jpetazzo/hamba`:
  ```yaml
    redis:
      image: jpetazzo/hamba
      command: 6379 `AA.BB.CC.DD EEEEE`
  ```

<!--
```edit
cat docker-compose.yml-ambassador | sed "s/AA.BB.CC.DD/$(curl myip.enix.org/REMOTE_ADDR)/" | sed "s/EEEEE/$(docker port myredis 6379 | cut -d: -f2)/" > docker-compose.yml
```
-->

]

Shortcut: `docker-compose.yml-ambassador`
<br/>(But you still have to update `AA.BB.CC.DD EEEEE`!)

---

## Start the stack on the first machine

- Compose will detect the change in the `redis` service

- It will replace `redis` with a `jpetazzo/hamba` instance

.exercise[

- Just tell Compose to do its thing:
  <br/>`docker-compose up -d`

- Check that the stack is up and running:
  <br/>`docker-compose ps`

- Look at the web UI to make sure that it works fine

]

---

## Controlling other Docker Engines

- Many tools in the ecosystem will honor the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable

- Those tools include (obviously!) the Docker CLI and Docker Compose

- Our training VMs have been setup to accept API requests on port 55555
  <br/>(without authentication - this is very insecure, by the way!)

.exercise[

- Set the `DOCKER_HOST` variable to control `node2`, and execute a `docker` command:
  ```bash
  export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://node2:55555
  docker ps
  ```

]

You shouldn't see any container running at this point.

---

## Start the stack on another machine

- We will tell Compose to bring up our stack on the other node

- It will use the local code (we don't need to checkout the code on `node2`)

.exercise[

- Start the stack:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d
  ```

- Check that it's running:
  ```bash
  docker-compose ps
  ```

]

---

## Run the application on every node

- We will repeat the previous step with a little shell loop

  ... but introduce parallelism to save some time

.exercise[

- Deploy one instance of the stack on each node:

  ```bash
    for N in 3 4 5; do
      DOCKER_HOST=tcp://node$N:55555 docker-compose up -d &
    done
    wait
  ```

]

Note: building the stack everywhere is not optimal. We will see later
how to build once, and deploy the same build everywhere.

---

## Scale!

- The app is built (and running!) everywhere

- Scaling can be done very quickly

.exercise[

- Add a bunch of workers all over the place:

  ```bash
    for N in 1 2 3 4 5; do
      DOCKER_HOST=tcp://node$N:55555 docker-compose scale worker=10
    done
  ```

- Admire the result in the web UI!

]

---

## Social Media Moment

Let's celebrate our success!

(And the fact that we're just 2498349893849283948982 DockerCoins away from being able to afford a cup of coffee!)

.exercise[

- If you have a Twitter account, tweet your mining speed!
  </br>(use the "Tweet this!" link below the graph‚ò∫)

]

---

## A few words about development volumes

- Try to access the web UI on another node

--

- It doesn't work! Why?

--

- Static assets are masked by an empty volume

--

- We need to comment out the `volumes` section

---

## Why must we comment out the `volumes` section?

- Volumes have multiple uses:

  - storing persistent stuff (database files...)

  - sharing files between containers (logs, configuration...)

  - sharing files between host and containers (source...)

- The `volumes` directive expands to an host path:
 
  `/home/docker/orchestration-workshop/dockercoins/webui/files`

- This host path exists on the local machine (not on the others)

- This specific volume is used in development (not in production)

---

## Stop the app (but leave Redis running)

- Let's use `docker-compose down`

- It will stop and remove the DockerCoins app (but leave other containers running)

.exercise[

- We can do another simple parallel shell loop:
  ```bash
    for N in $(seq 1 5); do
      export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://node$N:55555
      docker-compose down &
    done
    wait
  ```

]

(We need to keep the `myredis` container for
our next section, which will be about backups!)

---

# Various considerations about ambassadors

- "But, ambassadors are adding an extra hop!"

--

- Yes, but if you need load balancing, you need that hop

- Ambassadors actually *save* one hop
  <br/>(they act as local load balancers)

  - traditional load balancer:
    <br/>client ‚áí external LB ‚áí server (2 physical hops)

  - ambassadors:
    <br/>client ‚Üí ambassador ‚áí server (1 physical hop)

--

- Ambassadors are more reliable than traditional LBs
  <br/>(they are colocated with their clients)

---

## Inconvenients of ambassadors

- Generic issues
  <br/>(shared with any kind of load balancing / HA setup)

  - extra logical hop (not transparent to the client)

  - must assess backend health

  - one more thing to worry about (!)

- Specific issues

  - load balancing fairness

High-end load balancing solutions will rely on back pressure
from the backends. This addresses the fairness issue.

---

## There are many ways to deploy ambassadors

"Ambassador" is a design pattern.

There are many ways to implement it.

We will present three increasingly complex (but also powerful)
ways to deploy ambassadors.

---

## Single-tier ambassador deployment

- One-shot configuration process

- Must be executed manually after each scaling operation

- Scans current state, updates load balancer configuration

- Pros:
  <br/>- simple, robust, no extra moving part
  <br/>- easy to customize (thanks to simple design)
  <br/>- can deal efficiently with large changes

- Cons:
  <br/>- must be executed after each scaling operation
  <br/>- harder to compose different strategies

- Example: this workshop

---

## Two-tier ambassador deployment

- Daemon listens to Docker events API

- Reacts to container start/stop events

- Adds/removes back-ends to load balancers configuration

- Pros:
  <br/>- no extra step required when scaling up/down

- Cons:
  <br/>- extra process to run and maintain
  <br/>- deals with one event at a time (ordering matters)

- Hidden gotcha: load balancer creation

- Example: interlock

---

## Three-tier ambassador deployment


- Daemon listens to Docker events API

- Reacts to container start/stop events

- Adds/removes scaled services in distributed config DB (zookeeper, etcd, consul‚Ä¶)

- Another daemon listens to config DB events,
  <br/>adds/removes backends to load balancers configuration

- Pros:
  <br/>- more flexibility

- Cons:
  <br/>- three extra services to run and maintain

- Example: registrator

---

## Other multi-host communication mechanisms

- Overlay networks

  - weave, flannel, pipework ...

- Network plugins

  - available since Engine 1.9

- Allow a flat network for your containers

- Often requires an extra service to deal with BUM packets (broadcast/unknown/multicast)

  - e.g. a key/value store (Consul, Etcd, Zookeeper ...)

- Load balancers and/or failover mechanisms still needed

---

class: title

# Interlude <br/>

# Docker for ops

---

# Backups

- Redis is still running (with name `myredis`)

- We want to enable backups without touching it

- We will use a special backup container:

  - sharing the same volumes

  - linked to it (to connect to it easily)

  - possibly containing our backup tools

- This works because the `redis` container image stores its data on a volume

---

## Starting the backup container

.exercise[

- Make sure you're talking to the initial host:

  ```bash
  unset DOCKER_HOST
  ```

<!--
```meta
^{
```
-->

- Start the container:

  ```bash
    docker run --link myredis:redis \
               --volumes-from myredis \
               -v /tmp/myredis:/output \
               -ti alpine sh
  ```

- Look in `/data` in the container (that's where Redis puts its data dumps)
]

---

## Connecting to Redis

- We need to tell Redis to perform a data dump *now*

.exercise[

- Connect to Redis:
  ```bash
  telnet redis 6379
  ```

- Issue commands `SAVE` then `QUIT`

- Look at `/data` again (notice the time stamps)

]

- There should be a recent dump file now!

---

## Getting the dump out of the container

- We could use many things:

  - s3cmd to copy to S3
  - SSH to copy to a remote host
  - gzip/bzip/etc before copying

- We'll just copy it to the Docker host

.exercise[

- Copy the file from `/data` to `/output`

- Exit the container

- Look into `/tmp/myredis` (on the host)

<!--
```meta
^}
```
-->

]

---

## Scheduling backups

In the "old world," we (generally) use cron.

With containers, what are our options?

--

- run `cron` on the Docker host, and put `docker run` in the crontab

--

- run `cron` in the backup container, and make sure it keeps running
  <br/>(e.g. with `docker run --restart=‚Ä¶`)

--

- run `cron` in a container, and start backup containers from there

--

- listen to the Docker events stream, automatically scheduling backups
  <br/>when database containers are started

---

# Docker events stream

- Using the Docker API, we can get real-time
  notifications of everything happening in the Engine:

  - container creation/destruction
  - container start/stop
  - container exit/signal/out of memory
  - container attach/detach
  - volume creation/destruction
  - network creation/destruction
  - connection/disconnection of containers

(Networks will be covered a bit later!)

---

## Subscribing to the events stream

- This is done with `docker events`

.exercise[

- Get a stream of events:
  ```bash
  docker events
  ```

<!--
```meta
^Z
```
-->

- In a new terminal, do *anything*:
  ```bash
  docker run --rm alpine sleep 10
  ```

]

You should see events for the lifecycle of the
container, as well as its connection/disconnection
to the default `bridge` network.

---

# Attaching labels

- You can attach arbitrary labels to engines and containers

- You can read the value of those labels

- You can use those labels as filters in some commands

.exercise[

- Start two containers, with and without a `backup` label:
  ```bash
  docker run -d --name leweb nginx
  docker run -d --name ledata --label backup=please redis
  ```

<!--
```meta
^K
```
-->

]

---

## Using labels as filters

- `docker ps` can take a `--filter` argument

.exercise[

- List only containers that have a `backup` label:
  ```bash
  docker ps --filter label=backup
  ```

- List only containers where the `backup` label
  has a specific value:
  ```bash
  docker ps --filter label=backup=please
  ```

]

---

## Filtering events

- On a large cluster, there will be *lots* of events
  <br/>(especially when using short-lived containers)

- `docker events` can also take a `--filter` argument

.exercise[

- Show events only for containers with a "backup" label:
  ```bash
  docker events --filter label=backup
  ```

<!--
```meta
^Z
```
-->

- In a different terminal, terminate our containers:
  ```bash
  docker kill leweb ledata
  ```

<!--
```meta
^K
```
-->

]

---

## Using `docker ps` in scripts

- The default output of `docker ps` has two flaws:

  - it is not machine-readable
  - some information is not shown

- This can be changed with the `--format` flag

.exercise[

- List containers that have a `backup` label;
  <br/>show their container ID, image, and the label:
  ```bash
    docker ps --filter label=backup \
              --format '{{ .ID }} {{ .Image }} {{ .Label "backup" }}'
  ```

]

---

# Logs

- Two strategies:

  - log to plain files on volumes

  - log to stdout
    <br/>(and use a logging driver)

---

## Logging to plain files on volumes

(Sorry, that part won't be hands-on!)

- Start a container with `-v /logs`

- Make sure that all log files are in `/logs`

- To check logs, run e.g.

  ```bash
  docker run --volumes-from ... ubuntu sh -c "grep WARN /logs/*.log"
  ```

- Or just go interactive:

  ```bash
  docker run --volumes-from ... -ti ubuntu
  ```

- You can (should) start a log shipper that way

---

## Logging to stdout

- All containers should write to stdout/stderr

- Docker will collect logs and pass them to a logging driver

- Logging driver can specified globally, and per container
  <br/>(changing it for a container overrides the global setting)

- To change the global logging driver, pass extra flags to the daemon
  <br/>(requires a daemon restart)

- To override the logging driver for a container, pass extra flags to `docker run`

---

## Specifying logging flags

- `--log-driver`

  *selects the driver*

- `--log-opt key=val`

  *adds driver-specific options*
  <br/>*(can be repeated multiple times)*

- The flags are identical for `docker daemon` and `docker run`

---

## Logging flags in practice

- If you provision your nodes with Docker Machine,
  you can set global logging flags (which will apply to all
  containers started by a given Engine) like this:
  
  ```bash
  docker-machine create ... --engine-opt log-driver=...
  ```

- Otherwise, use your favorite method to edit or manage configuration files

- You can set per-container logging options in Compose files

---

## Available drivers

- json-file (default)

- syslog (can send to UDP, TCP, TCP+TLS, UNIX sockets)

- awslogs (AWS CloudWatch)

- journald

- gelf

- fluentd

- splunk

---

## About json-file ...

- It doesn't rotate logs by default, so your disks will fill up

  (Unless you set `maxsize` *and* `maxfile` log options.)

- It's the only one supporting logs retrieval

  (If you want to use `docker logs`, `docker-compose logs`,
  or fetch logs from the Docker API, you need json-file!)

- This might change in the future

  (But it's complex since there is no standard protocol
  to *retrieve* log entries.)

All about logging in the documentation:
https://docs.docker.com/reference/logging/overview/

---

# Storing container logs in an ELK stack

*Important foreword: this is not an "official" or "recommended"
setup; it is just an example. We do not endorse ELK, GELF,
or the other elements of the stack more than others!*

What we will do:

- Spin up an ELK stack, with Compose

- Gaze at the spiffy Kibana web UI

- Manually send a few log entries over GELF

- Reconfigure our DockerCoins app to send logs to ELK

---

## What's in an ELK stack?

- ELK is three components:

  - ElasticSearch (to store and index log entries)

  - Logstash (to receive log entries from various
    sources, process them, and forward them to various
    destinations)

  - Kibana (to view/search log entries with a nice UI)

- The only component that we will configure is Logstash

- We will accept log entries using the GELF protocol

- Log entries will be stored in ElasticSearch,
  <br/>and displayed on Logstash's stdout for debugging

---

## Starting our ELK stack

- We will use a *separate* Compose file

- The Compose file is in the `elk` directory

.exercise[

- Go to the `elk` directory:
  ```bash
  cd ~/orchestration-workshop/elk
  ```

- Start the ELK stack:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d
  ```

]

---

## Checking that our ELK stack works

- Our default Logstash configuration sends a test
  message every minute

- All messages are stored into ElasticSearch,
  but also shown on Logstash stdout

.exercise[

- Look at Logstash stdout:
  ```bash
  docker-compose logs logstash
  ```

]

After less than one minute, you should see a `"message" => "ok"`
in the output.

---

## Connect to Kibana

- Our ELK stack exposes two public services:
  <br/>the Kibana web server, and the GELF UDP socket

.exercise[

- Check the port number for the Kibana UI:
  ```bash
  docker-compose ps kibana
  ```

- Open the UI in your browser
  <br/>(Use the instance IP address and the public port number)

]

---

## "Configuring" Kibana

- If you see a status page with a yellow item, wait a minute and reload
  (Kibana is probably still initializing)

- Kibana should offer you to "Configure an index pattern",
  just click the "Create" button

- Then:

  - click "Discover" (in the top-left corner)
  - click "Last 15 minutes" (in the top-right corner)
  - click "Last 1 hour" (in the list in the middle)
  - click "Auto-refresh" (top-right corner)
  - click "5 seconds" (top-left of the list)

- You should see a series of green bars (with one new green bar every minute)

---

![Screenshot of Kibana](kibana.png)

---

## Sending container output to Kibana

- We will create a simple container displaying "hello world"

- We will override the container logging driver

.exercise[

- Check the port number for the GELF socket:
  ```bash
  docker-compose ps logstash
  ```

- Note the port number, and start our one-off container:

  <!--
  ```placeholder
  EEEEE 32768
  ```
  -->

  ```bash
    docker run --rm --log-driver gelf \
           --log-opt gelf-address=udp://127.0.0.1:`EEEEE` \
           alpine echo hello world
  ```

]

---

## Visualizing container logs in Kibana

- Less than 5 seconds later (the refresh rate of the UI),
  the log line should be visible in the web UI

- We can customize the web UI to be more readable

.exercise[

- In the left column, move the mouse over the following
  columns, and click the "Add" button that appears:

  - host
  - container_name
  - message

]

---

## Removing the old deployment of DockerCoins

- Before redeploying DockerCoins, remove everything

.exercise[

- Go back to the dockercoins directory:
  <br/>`cd ~/orchestration-workshop/dockercoins`

- Stop and remove all DockerCoins containers:
  <br/>`docker-compose kill && docker-compose rm -f`

- Reset the Compose file:
  <br/>`git checkout docker-compose.yml`

- Point the Docker API to a single node:
  <br/>`unset DOCKER_HOST`

]

---

## Add the logging driver to the Compose file

- We need to add the logging section to each container

- We need the GELF endpoint that we
  got earlier with `docker-compose ps logstash`

.exercise[

- Edit the `docker-compose.yml` file, adding the following lines **to each container**:

  ```yaml
    log_driver: gelf
    log_opt:
      gelf-address: "udp://127.0.0.1:`EEEEE`"
  ```

<!--
```edit
cat docker-compose.yml-logging | sed "s/EEEEE/32768/" > docker-compose.yml
```
-->

]

Shortcut: `docker-compose.yml-logging` (remember to update the port number!)

---

## Start the DockerCoins app

.exercise[

- Use Compose normally:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d
  ```

]

If you look in the Kibana web UI, you will see log lines
refreshed every 5 seconds.

Note: to do interesting things (graphs, searches...) we
would need to create indexes. This is beyond the scope
of this workshop.

---

## Logging in production

- If we were using an ELK stack:

  - scale ElasticSearch
  - scale Logstash
  - move away from UDP *or* put one Logstash per node
  - interpose a Redis or Kafka queue

- Configure your Engines to send all logs to ELK by default

- Start the logging containers with a different logging system
  <br/>(to avoid a logging loop)

- Make sure you don't end up writing *all logs* on the nodes running Logstash!

---

# Security upgrades

- This section is not hands-on

- Public Service Announcement

- We'll discuss:

  - how to upgrade the Docker daemon

  - how to upgrade container images

---

## Upgrading the Docker daemon

- Stop all containers cleanly

- Stop the Docker daemon

- Upgrade the Docker daemon

- Start the Docker daemon

- Start all containers

- This is like upgrading your Linux kernel, but it will get better

(Docker Engine 1.11 is using containerd, which will ultimately allow seamless upgrades.)

---

## In practice

- Keep track of running containers before stopping the Engine:
  ```bash
  docker ps --no-trunc -q |
  tee /tmp/running |
  xargs -n1 -P10 docker stop
  ```

- Restart those containers after the Engine is running again:
  ```bash
  xargs docker start < /tmp/running
  ```
  <br/>(Run this multiple times if you have linked containers!)

---

## Upgrading container images

- When a vulnerability is announced:

  - if it affects your base images: make sure they are fixed first

  - if it affects downloaded packages: make sure they are fixed first

  - re-pull base images

  - rebuild

  - restart containers

---

## How do we know when to upgrade?

- Subscribe to CVE notifications

  - https://cve.mitre.org/

  - your distros' security announcements

- Check CVE status in official images
  <br/>(tag [cve-tracker](
  https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/labels/cve-tracker)
  in [docker-library/official-images](
  https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/labels/cve-tracker)
  repo)

- Coming soon: Project Nautilus
  <br/>(see [this DC15EU presentation](
  http://www.slideshare.net/Docker/official-repos-and-project-nautilus/26))

---

## Upgrading with Compose

Compose makes this particularly easy:
```bash
docker-compose build --pull --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
```

This will automatically:

- pull base images;
- rebuild all container images;
- bring up the new containers.

Remember: Compose will automatically move our
volumes to the new containers, so data is preserved.

---

# Network traffic analysis

- We still have `myredis` running

- We will use *shared network namespaces* to perform network analysis

- Two containers sharing the same network namespace...

  - have the same IP addresses

  - have the same network interfaces

- `eth0` is therefore the same in both containers

---

## Install and start `ngrep`

Ngrep uses libpcap (like tcpdump) to sniff network traffic.

.exercise[

<!--
```meta
^{
```
-->

- Start a container with the same network namespace:
  <br/>`docker run --net container:dockercoins_redis_1 -ti alpine sh`

- Install ngrep:
  <br/>`apk update && apk add ngrep`

- Run ngrep:
  <br/>`ngrep -tpd eth0 -Wbyline . tcp`

<!--
```meta
^}
```
-->

]

You should see a stream of Redis requests and responses.

# Dynamic orchestration

---

## Static vs Dynamic

- Static

  - you decide what goes where

  - simple to describe and implement

  - seems easy at first but doesn't scale efficiently

- Dynamic

  - the system decides what goes where

  - requires extra components (HA KV...)

  - scaling can be finer-grained, more efficient

---

## Mesos (overview)

- First presented in 2009

- Initial goal: resource scheduler (two-level/pessimistic)

  - top-level "master" knows the global cluster state

  - "slave" nodes report status and resources to master

  - master allocates resources to "frameworks"

- Container support added recently (had to fit existing model)

- Network and service discovery is complex

---

## Mesos (in practice)

- Super easy to setup a test cluster
  <br/>(e.g. [minimesos](https://minimesos.org/) put all Mesos components in container)

- Great to accommodate mixed workloads
  <br/>(see Marathon, Chronos, Aurora, and many more)

- "Meh" if you only want to run Docker containers

- In production on clusters of thousands of nodes

- Open source project; commercial support available

---

## Kubernetes (overview)

- Started in June 2014

- Designed specifically as a platform for containers ("greenfield" design)

  - "pods" = groups of containers sharing network/storage

  - Scaling and HA managed by "replication controllers"

  - extensive use of "tags" instead of e.g. tree hierarchy

- Initially designed around Docker, but doesn't hesitate to diverge in a few places

---

## Kubernetes (in practice)

- Network and service discovery is powerful, but complex
  <br/>.small[(different mechanisms within pod, between pods, for inbound traffic...)]

- Initially designed around GCE
  <br/>.small[(networking and persistence work better on GCE, but this is getting better)]

- Tends to be loved by ops more than devs
  <br/>.small[(but keep in mind that it's evolving quite as fast as Docker)]

- Setting up a local development cluster is non-trivial
  <br/>.small[(the easiest way is to stage it up on e.g. GKE)]

- Bottom line: Kubernetes is not Docker!
  <br/>.small[(different concepts, APIs, tooling, concepts, configuration files...)]

---

## ECS (overview)

- Amazon EC2 Container Service

- "Bring your own instance"

- "Native" container scheduler on AWS

- Some integration with other AWS products

- No extra component to operate

- Defines new concepts:

  - task
  - task definition
  - service

---

## ECS (in practice)

- Task definitions look like Compose files, but are significantly different

- Integration with e.g. ELB is suboptimal
  <br/>(ELB requires all backends to run on the same port)

- Cluster deployment is made easier thanks to ECS CLI

- Docker API gets partially exposed through ECS API, with some features lagging behind

- Service discovery is painful

---

## Nomad (overview)

- Generic job scheduler
  <br/>(not only for containers)

- Desired state is stored in Consul

- Nodes pull jobs from Consul

- Scheduling happens in parallel

---

## Nomad (in practice)

*Disclaimer: I have little first-hand experience with Nomad!*

- Does only one thing, but does it really well

- Works with jobs, not applications, services, etc.

- As I understand it: Nomad is an excellent building block,
  <br/>but you need to add other components to deploy your apps

---

## Swarm (in theory)

- Consolidates multiple Docker hosts into a single one

- You talk to Swarm using the Docker API
  
  ‚Üí you can use all existing tools: Docker CLI, Docker Compose, etc.

- Swarm talks to your Docker Engines using the Docker API too

  ‚Üí you can use existing Engines without modification

- Dispatches (schedules) your containers across the cluster, transparently

- Open source and written in Go (like Docker)

- Started by two of the original Docker authors
  ([@aluzzardi](https://twitter.com/aluzzardi) and [@vieux](https://twitter.com/vieux))

---

## Swarm (in practice)

- Stable since November 2015

- Initially for small setups, easy to setup

- Tested with 1000 nodes + 50000 containers
  <br/>.small[(without particular tuning; see DockerCon EU opening keynotes!)]

- Still easy to setup, but scales perfectly to larger deployments too

- Requires a key/value store for advanced features

- We'll see it in action!

???

## PAAS on Docker

- The PAAS workflow: *just push code*
  <br/>(inspired by Heroku, dotCloud...)

- TL,DR: easier for devs, harder for ops,
  <br/>some very opinionated choices

- A few examples:
  <br/>(Non-exhaustive list!!!)

  - Cloud Foundry
  - Deis
  - Dokku
  - Flynn
  - Tsuru

*Docker made it very easy to cobble your own PAAS.*

???

## A few other tools

- Volume plugins (Convoy, Flocker...)

  - manage/migrate stateful containers (and more)

- Network plugins (Contiv, Weave...)

  - overlay network so that containers can ping each other

- Docker Cloud (Tutum), Docker UCP (Universal Control Plane)

  - dashboards to manage fleets of Docker hosts

... And many more!

# Hands-on Swarm

---

class: pic

![Swarm Logo](swarm.png)

---

## Setting up our Swarm cluster

- This can be done manually or with **Docker Machine**

- Manual deployment:

  - with TLS: certificate generation is painful
    <br/>(needs dual-use certs)

  - without TLS: easier, but insecure
    <br/>(unless you run on your internal/private network)

- Docker Machine deployment:

  - generates keys, certificates, and deploys them for you

  - can also create VMs

---

## The Way Of The Machine

- Install `docker-machine` (single binary download)

- Set a few environment variables (cloud credentials)

- Create one or more machines:
  <br/>`docker-machine create -d digitalocean node42`

- List machines and their status:
  <br/>`docker-machine ls`

- Select a machine for use:
  <br/>`eval $(docker-machine env node42)`
  <br/>(this will set a few environment variables)

- Execute regular commands with Docker, Compose, etc.
  <br/>(they will pick up remote host address from environment)

---

## Docker Machine `generic` driver

- Most drivers work the same way:

  - use cloud API to create instance

  - connect to instance over SSH

  - install Docker

- The `generic` driver skips the first step

- It can install Docker on any machine, as long as you have SSH access

- We will use that!

---

# Deploying Swarm

- Components involved:

  - cluster discovery mechanism
    <br/>(so that the manager can learn about the nodes)

  - Swarm manager
    <br/>(your frontend to the cluster)

  - Swarm agent
    <br/>(runs on each node, registers it with service discovery)

---

# Cluster discovery

- Possible backends:

  - dynamic, self-hosted
    <br/>(requires to run a Consul/Etcd/Zookeeper cluster)

  - static, through command-line or file
    <br/>(great for testing, or for private subnets, see [this article](
    https://medium.com/on-docker/docker-swarm-flat-file-engine-discovery-2b23516c71d4#.6vp94h5wn)

  - external, token-based
    <br/>(dynamic; nothing to operate; relies on external service operated by Docker Inc.)

- We will use the token mechanism

---

## Generating our Swarm discovery token

The token is a unique identifier, corresponding to a bucket
in the discovery service hosted by Docker Inc.

(You can consider it as a rendez-vous point for your cluster.)

.exercise[

- Create your token, saving it preciously to disk as well:

  ```bash
  TOKEN=$(docker run swarm create | tee token)
  ```

]

---

## Swarm agent

- Used only for dynamic discovery (zk, etcd, consul, token)

- Must run on each node

- Every 20s (by default), tells to the discovery system:
  </br>"Hello, there is a Swarm node at A.B.C.D:EFGH"

- Must know the node's IP address
  <br/>(sorry, it can't figure it out by itself, because
  <br/>it doesn't know whether to use public or private addresses)

- The node continues to work even if the agent dies

- Automatically started by Docker Machine (when the `--swarm` option is passed)

---

## Swarm manager

- Accepts Docker API requests
- Communicates with the cluster nodes
- Performs healthchecks, scheduling...

.exercise[

- Double-check that you are on `node1`

- Provision a node with Docker Machine:

  <!--
  ```placeholder
  AA.BB.CC.DD $(getent hosts node1 | awk '{print $1}')
  ```
  -->

  ```bash
    docker-machine create --driver generic \
      --swarm --swarm-master --swarm-discovery token://$TOKEN \
      --generic-ssh-user docker --generic-ip-address `AA.BB.CC.DD` node1
  ```

]

(Don't forget to replace AA.BB.CC.DD with the node IP address!)

---

## Redundancy

- The manager is a SPOF

- If you lose the manager:

  - you can't control the cluster anymore

  - you can still control individual nodes

  - you can start a new manager (at this point, it is stateless)

- We'll setup active/passive redundancy later

---

## Check our node

Let's connect to the node *individually*.

.exercise[

- Select the node with Machine

  ```bash
  eval $(docker-machine env node1)
  ```

- Execute some Docker commands

  ```bash
  docker version
  docker info
  docker ps
  ```

]

Two containers should show up: the agent and the manager.

---

## Check our (single-node) Swarm cluster

Let's connect to the manager instead.

.exercise[

- Select the Swarm manager with Machine

  ```bash
  eval $(docker-machine env node1 --swarm)
  ```

<!--
```bash
while ! docker info | grep -q "^Nodes: 1"; do
  sleep 1
done
```
-->

- Execute some Docker commands

  ```bash
  docker version
  docker info
  docker ps
  ```

]

The output is different! Let's review this.

---

## `docker version`

Swarm identifies itself clearly:

```
Client:
 Version:      1.10.2
 API version:  1.22
 Go version:   go1.5.3
 Git commit:   c3959b1
 Built:        Mon Feb 22 21:40:35 2016
 OS/Arch:      linux/amd64

Server:
 Version:      swarm/1.1.3
 API version:  1.22
 Go version:   go1.5.3
 Git commit:   7e9c6bd
 Built:        Wed Mar  2 00:15:12 UTC 2016
 OS/Arch:      linux/amd64
```

---

## `docker info`

Swarm gives cluster information, showing all nodes:

.small[
```
Containers: 3
Images: 6
Role: primary
Strategy: spread
Filters: affinity, health, constraint, port, dependency
Nodes: 1
 node1: 52.58.50.15:2376
  ‚îî Status: Healthy
  ‚îî Containers: 3
  ‚îî Reserved CPUs: 0 / 2

            provider=generic,
            storagedriver=aufs
  ‚îî Error: (none)
  ‚îî UpdatedAt: 2016-03-09T14:01:43Z
Kernel Version: 4.2.0-30-generic
Operating System: linux
Architecture: amd64
CPUs: 2
Total Memory: 3.86 GiB
Name: node1
```
]

---

## `docker ps`

- This one should show nothing at this point

- The Swarm containers are hidden

- This avoids unneeded pollution

- This also avoids killing them by mistake

- We can still see them with `docker ps -a`, though

---

## Add other nodes to the cluster

- Let's use *almost* the same command line (but without `--swarm-master`)

.exercise[

- Stay on `node1` (it has keys and certificates now!)

- Add another node with Docker Machine

  <!--
  ```placeholder
  AA.BB.CC.DD $(getent hosts node2 | awk '{print $1}')
  ```
  -->

  ```bash
    TOKEN=$(cat token)
    docker-machine create --driver generic \
      --swarm --swarm-discovery token://$TOKEN \
      --generic-ssh-user docker --generic-ip-address `AA.BB.CC.DD` node2
  ```

]

Remember to replace AA.BB.CC.DD with the correct IP address.

Repeat for all 4 nodes. (Pro tip: look for name/address mapping in `/etc/hosts`!)

---

## Scripting

- We can automate the remaining nodes with a little shell script

.exercise[

- Deploy nodes 3, 4, and 5:
  ```bash
    TOKEN=$(cat token)
    grep node[345] /etc/hosts | grep -v ^127 |
    while read IPADDR NODENAME
    do docker-machine create --driver generic \
      --swarm --swarm-discovery token://$TOKEN \
      --generic-ssh-user docker \
      --generic-ip-address $IPADDR $NODENAME
    done
  ```

]

---

## Checking the state of our cluster

.exercise[

<!--
```bash
while ! docker info | grep -q "^Nodes: 5"; do
  sleep 1
done
```
-->

- Check that all nodes are here:
  ```bash
  docker info
  ```
]

If less than 5 nodes show up, just retry every few seconds: the
nodes need some time to register themselves with the service discovery mechanism.

---

## Running containers on Swarm

Try to run a few `busybox` containers.

Then, let's get serious:

.exercise[

- Start a Redis service:
  <br/>`docker run -dP redis`

- See the service address:
  <br/>`docker port $(docker ps -lq) 6379`

]

This can be any of your five nodes.

---

## Scheduling strategies

- Random: pick a node at random
  <br/>(but honor resource constraints)

- Spread: pick the node with the least containers
  <br/>(including stopped containers)

- Binpack: try to maximize resource usage
  <br/>(in other words: use as few hosts as possible)

---

# Resource allocation

- Swarm can honor resource reservations

- This requires containers to be started with resource limits

- Swarm refuses to schedule a container if it cannot honor a reservation

.exercise[

- Start Redis containers with 1 GB of RAM until Swarm refuses to start more:
  ```bash
  docker run -d -m 1G redis
  ```

]

On a cluster of 5 nodes with ~3.8 GB of RAM per node, Swarm will refuse to start the 16th container.

---

## Things to know about resource allocation

- `docker info` shows resource allocation for each node

- Swarm allows a 5% resource overcommit (tunable)

- Containers without resource reservation can always be started

- Resources of stopped containers are still counted as being reserved

  - this guarantees that it will be possible to restart a stopped container

  - containers have to be deleted to free up their resources

  - `docker update` can be used to change resource allocation on the fly

---

# Building our app on Swarm

Before trying to build our app, we will remove previous images.

.exercise[

- Delete all images with "dockercoins" in the name:

  ```bash
  docker images |
    grep dockercoins |
    awk '{print $1}' |
    xargs -r docker rmi -f
  ```

]

---

## Building our app on Swarm

- Compose now supports builds on Swarm (older versions would crash)

.exercise[

- Run `docker-compose build`

- Try to start and scale the application:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d
  docker-compose scale worker=10
  docker-compose scale webui=2
  ```

]

.warning[This is supposed to fail! Don't bang your head on the keyboard if it doesn't work!]

---

## Caveats when building with Swarm

- Containers are only scheduled where they were built

  - cause: Swarm will not automatically copy images across nodes

  - solution: distribute images through a registry (e.g. Docker Hub)

- You can end up with inconsistent versions
  <br/>(i.e. `dockercoins_rng:latest` being different on two nodes)

  - cause: builds can happen on different nodes

  - solution: always pin builds to the same node; use explicit version tags

- Also, build caching doesn't work all the time

---

## Why can't Swarm do this automatically for us?

- Let's step back and think for a minute ...

- What should `docker build` do on Swarm?

  - build on one machine

  - build everywhere ($$$)

- After the build, what should `docker run` do?

  - run where we built (how do we know where it is?)

  - run on any machine that has the image

- Could Compose+Swarm solve this automatically?

---

## A few words about "sane defaults"

- *It would be nice if Swarm could pick a node, and build there!*

  - but which node should it pick?
  - what if the build is very expensive?
  - what if we want to distribute the build across nodes?
  - what if we want to tag some builder nodes?
  - ok but what if no node has been tagged?

- *It would be nice if Swarm could automatically push images!*

  - using the Docker Hub is an easy choice
    <br/>(you just need an account)
  - but some of us can't/won't use Docker Hub
    <br/>(for compliance reasons or because no network access)

.small[("Sane" defaults are nice only if we agree on the definition of "sane")]

---

## The plan

- Build locally

- Tag images

- Upload them to a registry

- Update the Compose file to use those images

*That's the purpose of the `build-tag-push.py` script!*

---

## Which registry do we want to use?

.small[

- **Docker Hub**

  - hosted by Docker Inc.
  - requires an account (free, no credit card needed)
  - images will be public (unless you pay)
  - located in AWS EC2 us-east-1

- **Docker Trusted Registry**

  - self-hosted commercial product
  - requires a subscription (free 30-day trial available)
  - images can be public or private
  - located wherever you want

- **Docker open source registry**

  - self-hosted barebones repository hosting
  - doesn't require anything
  - doesn't come with anything either
  - located wherever you want
]

---

## Using Docker Hub

- Set the `DOCKER_REGISTRY` environment variable to your Docker Hub user name
  <br/>(the `build-tag-push.py` script prefixes each image name with that variable)

- We will also see how to run the open source registry
  <br/>(so use whatever option you want!)

.exercise[

<!--
```meta
^{
```
-->

- Set the following environment variable:
  <br/>`export DOCKER_REGISTRY=jpetazzo`

- (Use *your* Docker Hub login, of course!)

- Log into the Docker Hub:
  <br/>`docker login`

<!--
```meta
^}
```
-->

]

---

## Using Docker Trusted Registry

If we wanted to use DTR, we would:

- make sure we have a Docker Hub account
- [activate a Docker Datacenter subscription](
  https://hub.docker.com/enterprise/trial/)
- install DTR on our machines
- set `DOCKER_REGISTRY` to `dtraddress:port/user`

*This is out of the scope of this workshop!*

---

## Using open source registry

- We need to run a `registry:2` container
  <br/>(make sure you specify tag `:2` to run the new version!)

- It will store images and layers to the local filesystem
  <br/>(but you can add a config file to use S3, Swift, etc.)

- Docker *requires* TLS when communicating with the registry,
  unless for registries on `localhost` or with the Engine
  flag `--insecure-registry`

- We will run an ambassador on each node
  of the cluster, redirecting `localhost:5000` to
  the registry

---

## Deploying our open source registry

.exercise[

- Start your registry on your Swarm cluster:
  ```bash
  eval $(docker-machine env node1 --swarm)
  docker run -dP --name registry registry:2
  ```

- Start five ambassadors (one per node):
  ```bash
    for N in $(seq 1 5); do
      docker run -d -p 5000:5000 jpetazzo/hamba \
             5000 $(docker port registry 5000)
    done
  ```

]

---

## Testing our local registry

- We can retag a small image, and push it to the registry

.exercise[

- Make sure we have the busybox image:
  ```bash
  docker pull busybox
  ```

- Retag the busybox image:
  ```bash
  docker tag busybox localhost:5000/busybox
  ```

- Push it:
  ```bash
  docker push localhost:5000/busybox
  ```

]

---

## Using our local registry

- The `build-tag-push.py` script uses the `DOCKER_REGISTRY`
  environment variable

.exercise[

- Set the `DOCKER_REGISTRY` variable:
  ```bash
  export DOCKER_REGISTRY=localhost:5000
  ```

]

---

## Build, Tag, And Push

Let's inspect the source code of `build-tag-push.py` and run it.

.warning[Make sure to run it against a single node!]

.warning[Make sure to use the original Compose file!]

.small[(We don't want the scaled RNG service, the custom logging driver, etc.)]

.exercise[

- Run `build-tag-push.py`:
  ```bash
  eval $(docker-machine env node1)
  git checkout docker-compose.yml
  ../bin/build-tag-push.py
  ```

]

Inspect the `docker-compose.yml-NNN` file that it created.

---

## Can we run this now?

Let's try!

.exercise[

- Switch back to the Swarm cluster:
  <br/>`eval $(docker-machine env node1 --swarm)`

- Protip - set the `COMPOSE_FILE` variable:
  <br/>`export COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml-NNN`

- Bring up the application:
  <br/>`docker-compose up`

]

.warning[This is *still* supposed to fail!]

--

(‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞)‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª

---

## Why do we get that weird error message?

- Compose and Swarm do not collaborate
  to establish *placement constraints*.

---

## Simple container dependencies

- Container A has a link to container B

- Compose starts B first, then A

- Swarm translates the link into a placement constraint:

  - *"put A on the same node as B"*

- Alles gut

---

## Complex container dependencies

- Container A has a link to containers B and C

- Compose starts B and C first
  <br/>(but that can be on different nodes!)

- Compose starts A

- Swarm translates the links into placements contraints

  - *"put A on the same node as B"*
  - *"put A on the same node as C"*

- If B and C are on different nodes, that's impossible

So, what do‚ÄΩ

---

## A word on placement constraints

- Swarm supports constraints

- We could tell Swarm to put all our containers together

- Linking would work

- But all containers would end up on the same node

--

- So having a cluster would be pointless!

---

## Connecting containers with Swarm (1/2)

- Implement service discovery in the application

  - requires extensive code changes

  - doesn't require extra services or containers

  - provides load balancing and failover

- Inject service addresses in environment variables

  - requires minimal code changes

  - doesn't require extra services or containers

  - doesn't provide load balancing and failover

---

## Connecting containers with Swarm (2/2)

- Ambassadors

  - don't require code changes

  - require additional containers

  - provide load balancing and failover

- Overlay networks

  - don't require code changes

  - don't require extra services or containers

  - doesn't provide load balancing and failover (yet)

---

# Connecting containers with ambassadors

- We will use one-tier, dynamic ambassadors

- Each link to a service will be replaced by an ambassador

- Each ambassador will be placed in the network namespace
  of the service using the ambassador

- Ambassadors will be dynamically reconfigured when
  linked services are updated

---

## Revisiting `jpetazzo/hamba`

- Configuration is stored in a *volume*

- A watcher process looks for configuration updates,
  <br/>and restarts HAProxy when needed

- It can be started without configuration:

  ```bash
  docker run --name amba jpetazzo/hamba run
  ```

- There is a helper to inject a new configuration:

  ```bash
  docker run --rm --volumes-from amba jpetazzo/hamba \
         reconfigure 80 backend1 port1 backend2 port2 ...
  ```

---

## Should we use `links` for our ambassadors?

Technically, we could use links.

- Before starting an app container:

  start the ambassador(s) it needs

- When starting an app container:

  link it to its ambassador(s)

But we wouldn't be able to use `docker-compose scale` anymore.

(We would have to scale the ambassadors *first*,
then add our client containers.)

---

## Network namespaces and `extra_hosts`

This is our plan:

- Replace each `link` with an `extra_host`,
  <br/>pointing to the `127.127.X.X` address space

- Start app containers normally
  <br/>(`docker-compose up`, `docker-compose scale`)

- Start ambassadors after app containers are up:

  - ambassadors bind to `127.127.X.X`

  - they share their client's network namespace

- Reconfigure ambassadors each time something changes

---

## Our plan for service discovery

- Replace all `links` with static `/etc/hosts` entries

- Those entries will map to `127.127.0.X`
  <br/>(with different `X` for each service)

- Example: `redis` will point to `127.127.0.2`
  <br/>(instead of a container address)

- Start all services; scale them if we want
  <br/>(at this point, they will all fail to connect)

- Start ambassadors in the services' namespace;
  <br/>each ambassador will listen on the right `127.127.0.X`

- Gather all backend addresses and configure ambassadors

.warning[Services should try to reconnect!]

---

## "Design for failure," they said

- When the containers are started, the network is not ready

- First connection attempts **will fail**

- App should try to reconnect

- It is OK to crash and restart

- Exponential back-off is nice

---

## Pictures worth 1000 words

- In the following diagrams, we are connecting a
  `www` service to a `redis` service through
  an ambassador.

## Our tools

- `link-to-ambassadors.py`

  - replaces all `links` with `extra_hosts` entries

- `create-ambassadors.py`

  - scans running containers
  - allocates `127.127.X.X` addresses
  - starts (unconfigured) ambassadors

- `configure-ambassadors.py`

  - scans running containers
  - gathers backend addresses
  - sends configuration to ambassadors

---

## Convert links to ambassadors

- When we ran `build-tag-push.py` earlier,
  <br/>it generated a new `docker-compose.yml-NNN` file.

.exercise[

- Run the first script to create a new YAML file:
  <br/>`../bin/link-to-ambassadors.py`

]

In the Compose file, all links have been replaced
by `extra_hosts` sections.

---

class: pic

## Current state

![Two empty hosts](ambassadors/dockercoins-1.png)

---

## Bring up the application

The application can now be started and scaled.

.exercise[

- Start the application:
  <br/>`docker-compose up -d`

]

Note: you can scale everything as you like, *except Redis*,
because it is stateful.

---

class: pic

## Current state

![Containers are running, but disconnected](ambassadors/dockercoins-2.png)

---

## Create the ambassadors

This has to be executed each time you create new services
or scale up existing ones.

After reading `$COMPOSE_FILE`, it will scan running containers, and compare:

- the list of app containers,
- the list of ambassadors.

It will create missing ambassadors.

.exercise[

- Run the script!
  <br/>`../bin/create-ambassadors.py`

]

---

class: pic

## Current state

![Ambassadors are started, but unconfigured](ambassadors/dockercoins-3.png)

---

## Configure the ambassadors

All ambassadors are created but they still need configuration.

That's the purpose of the last script.

It will read `$COMPOSE_FILE` and gather:

- the list of app backends,
- the list of ambassadors.

Then it configures all ambassadors with all found backends.

.exercise[

- Run it!
  <br/>`../bin/configure-ambassadors.py`

]

---

class: pic

## Current state

![Ambassadors are configured](ambassadors/dockercoins-4.png)

---

## Check what we did

.exercise[


- Find out the address of the web UI:
  <br/>`docker-compose ps webui`

- Point your browser to it

]

---

## Scale

- We will now add more containers.

.exercise[

- Scale worker and rng:
  ```bash
  docker-compose scale worker=5 rng=10
  ```

]

The performance graph stays at the same level.

If we look at the logs of the added workers, we will
see screenfuls of "connection refused" exceptions.

---

class: pic

## Current state

![New containers are there, but not ambassadors](ambassadors/dockercoins-5.png)

---

## Add ambassadors

- The new containers don't have ambassadors at this point.

.exercise[

- Create the missing ambassadors with the script:
  ```bash
  ../bin/create-ambassadors.py
  ```

]

The performance graph stays at the same level.

If we look at the logs of the added workers, we will
now see timeout errors instead of "connection refused."

---

class: pic

## Current state

![Now ambassadors are here, but unconfigured](ambassadors/dockercoins-6.png)

---

## Configure ambassadors

- The last step is to inject the updated configuration.

.exercise[

- Run the last script one more time:
  ```bash
  ../bin/configure-ambassadors.py
  ```

]

Now the performance graph climbs up, and the worker
logs show normal operation.

---

class: pic

## Current state

![All ambassadors are here and configured](ambassadors/dockercoins-7.png)

---

## Clean up

- Before moving on, stop and remove all containers

.exercise[

- Terminate and remove all containers:
  ```bash
  docker-compose down
  ```

- Remove ambassadors:
  ```bash
  ../bin/delete-ambassadors.sh
  ```

]

---

## A few words about those ambassadors

- There is "a lot" of added complexity here
  <br/>(5 scripts of almost 50 lines each!)

- Snark aside, those scripts tap into those concepts:

  - network namespaces
  - dynamic load balancer reconfiguration
  - sidekick containers that are *mandatory*
  - ... and have to be managed manually

- We are going to see an easier way to manage this!

---

# Setting up Consul and overlay networks

- We will reconfigure our Swarm cluster to enable overlays

- We will deploy a Consul cluster

- We will connect containers running on different machines

---

## First, let's Clean All The Things!

- We need to remove the old containers
  <br/>(in particular the `swarm` agents and managers)

.exercise[

- The following snippet will nuke all containers on all hosts:

  ```bash
    for N in 1 2 3 4 5
    do
      ssh node$N "docker ps -qa | xargs -r docker rm -f"
    done
  ```

(If it asks you to confirm SSH keys, just do it!)

]

Note: our Swarm cluster is now broken.

---

## Remove old Machine information

- We will use `docker-machine rm`

- With the `generic` driver, this doesn't do anything (it just deletes local configuration)

- With cloud/VM drivers, this would actually delete VMs

.exercise[

- Remove our nodes from Docker Machine config database:

  ```bash
    for N in 1 2 3 4 5
    do
      docker-machine rm -f node$N
    done
  ```

]

---

## Add extra options to our Engines

- We need two new options for our engines:

  - `cluster-store` (to indicate which key/value store to use)

  - `cluster-advertise` (to indicate which IP address to register)

- `cluster-store` will be `consul://localhost:8500`
  <br/>(we will run one Consul node on each machine)

- `cluster-advertise` will be `eth0:2376`
  <br/>(Engine will automatically pick up eth0's IP address)

---

## Reconfiguring Swarm clusters, the Docker way

- The traditional way to reconfigure a service is to edit
  its configuration (or init script), then restart

- Instead, we can use Machine's `generic` driver to
  redeploy with new parameters

.exercise[

- Re-provision the manager node:

  <!--
  ```placeholder
  AA.BB.CC.DD $(getent hosts node1 | awk '{print $1}')
  ```
  -->

  ```bash
    docker-machine create --driver generic \
      --engine-opt cluster-store=consul://localhost:8500 \
      --engine-opt cluster-advertise=eth0:2376 \
      --swarm --swarm-master --swarm-discovery consul://localhost:8500 \
      --generic-ssh-user docker --generic-ip-address `AA.BB.CC.DD` node1
  ```

]

---

## Reconfigure the other nodes

- Once again, scripting to the rescue!

.exercise[

```bash
  grep node[2345] /etc/hosts | grep -v ^127 |
  while read IPADDR NODENAME
  do docker-machine create --driver generic \
     --engine-opt cluster-store=consul://localhost:8500 \
     --engine-opt cluster-advertise=eth0:2376 \
     --swarm --swarm-discovery consul://localhost:8500 \
     --generic-ssh-user docker \
     --generic-ip-address $IPADDR $NODENAME
  done
```

]

---

## Checking what we did

.exercise[

- Directly point the CLI to a node and check configuration:

  ```bash
  eval $(docker-machine env node1)
  docker info
  ```

  (should show `Cluster store` and `Cluster advertise`)

- Try to talk to the Swarm cluster:

  ```bash
  eval $(docker-machine env node1 --swarm)
  docker info
  ```

  (should show zero node)

]

---

## Why zero node?

- We haven't started Consul yet

- Swarm discovery is not operationl

- Swarm can't discover the nodes

Note: Docker will start (and be functional) without a K/V store.

This lets us run Consul itself in a container.

---

## Adding Consul

- We will run Consul in containers

- We will use a
  [custom consul image](https://hub.docker.com/r/jpetazzo/consul/)

- We will tell Docker to automatically restart it on reboots

- To simplify network setup, we will use `host` networking

---

## Starting the first Consul node

.exercise[

- Make sure you're logged into `node1`,
  with a clean environment:

  ```bash
  unset DOCKER_HOST
  ```

- The first node must be started with the `-bootstrap` flag:

  ```bash
    CID=$(docker run --name consul_node1 \
          -d --restart=always --net host \
          jpetazzo/consul agent -server -bootstrap)
  ```

]

---

## Starting the other Consul nodes

- Other nodes have to be started with the `-join AA.BB.CC.DD`
  option, where AA.BB.CC.DD is the address of an existing node

.exercise[

- Find the internal IP address of our first node:
  ```bash
    IPADDR=$(ip a ls dev eth0 | sed -n 's,.*inet \(.*\)/.*,\1,p')
  ```

- Start the other nodes:
  ```bash
      for N in 2 3 4 5; do
      ssh node$N docker run --name consul_node$N -d --restart=always \
                --net host jpetazzo/consul agent -server -join $IPADDR
      done
  ```

]

---

## Check that our Consul cluster is up

- With your browser, navigate to any instance on port 8500
  <br/>(in "NODES" you should see the five nodes)

- Let's run a couple of useful Consul commands

.exercise[

- Ask Consul the list of members it knows:
  ```bash
  docker run --net host --rm jpetazzo/consul members
  ```

- Ask Consul which node is the current leader:
  ```bash
  curl localhost:8500/v1/status/leader
  ```

]

---

## Check that our Swarm cluster is up

.exercise[

- Try again the `docker info` from earlier:

  ```bash
  eval $(docker-machine env --swarm node1)
  docker info
  ```

- Now all nodes should be visible
  <br/>(Give them a minute or two to register)

]

---

# Multi-host networking

- Docker 1.9 has the concept of *networks*

- By default, containers are on the default "bridge" network

- You can create additional networks

- Containers can be on multiple networks

- Containers can dynamically join/leave networks

- The "overlay" driver lets networks span multiple hosts

- Let's see that in action!

---

## Create a few networks and containers

.exercise[

- Create two networks, *blue* and *green*:
  ```bash
  docker network create --driver overlay blue
  docker network create --driver overlay green
  docker network ls
  ```

- Create containers with names of blue and green
  things, on their respective networks:
  ```bash
  docker run -d --name sky --net blue -m 3G redis
  docker run -d --name navy --net blue -m 3G redis
  docker run -d --name grass --net green -m 3G redis
  docker run -d --name forest --net green -m 3G redis
  ```

]

---

## Check connectivity within networks

.exercise[

- Check that our containers are on different networks:

  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```

- This will work:

  ```bash
  docker exec -ti sky ping navy
  ```

- This will not:

  ```bash
  docker exec -ti navy ping grass
  ```

]

---

## Containers connected to multiple networks

- Some colors aren't *quite* blue *nor* green

.exercise[

- Create a container that we want to be on both networks:
  ```bash
  docker run -d --net blue --name turquoise nginx
  ```

- Check connectivity:
  ```bash
  docker exec -ti turquoise ping -c1 navy
  docker exec -ti turquoise ping -c1 grass
  ```
  (First works; second doesn't)

]

---

## Dynamically connecting containers

- This is achieved with the command:
  <br/>`docker network connect NETNAME CONTAINER`

.exercise[

- Dynamically connect to the green network:
  ```bash
  docker network connect green turquoise
  ```

- Check connectivity:
  ```bash
  docker exec -ti turquoise ping -c1 navy
  docker exec -ti turquoise ping -c1 grass
  ```
  (Both commands work now)

]

---

## Under the hood

- Each network has an interface in the container

- There is also an interface for the default gateway

.exercise[

- View interfaces in our `turquoise` container:
  ```bash
  docker exec -ti turquoise ip addr ls
  ```

]

---

## Dynamically disconnecting containers

- There is a mirror command to `docker network connect`

.exercise[

- Disconnect the *turquoise* container from *blue*
  (its original network):
  ```bash
  docker network disconnect blue turquoise
  docker network connect green turquoise
  ```

- Check connectivity:
  ```bash
  docker exec -ti turquoise ping -c1 navy
  docker exec -ti turquoise ping -c1 grass
  ```
  (First command fails, second one works)

]

---

## Cleaning up

.exercise[

- Destroy containers:

  ```bash
  docker rm -f sky navy grass forest turquoise
  ```

- Destroy networks:

  ```bash
  docker network rm blue
  docker network rm green
  ```

]

---

## Cleaning up after an outage or a crash

- You cannot remove a network if it still has containers

- There is no `"rm -f"` for network

- If a network still has stale endpoints, you can use `"disconnect -f"`

---

# Using overlay networks with Compose

- Compose 1.5 had `--x-networking` flag
  <br/>(enabling experimental support for overlay networks)

- Compose 1.6 has a new Compose file format
  <br/>(using the new format enables overlay networks support)

- Compose will remain backward compatible with old files

- Converting to new files is (ridiculously) easy

---

## Our first "Compose v2" app

- To deploy DockerCoins, we still need a local registry

- Let's deploy a local registry using a Compose File v2!

.exercise[

- Go to the `registry` directory in the repository:
  ```bash
  cd ~/orchestration-workshop/registry
  ```

]

Let's examine the `docker-compose.yml` file.

---

## Our first Compose v2 file

```yaml
version: "2"

services:
  backend:
    image: registry:2
  frontend:
    image: jpetazzo/hamba
    command: 5000 backend:5000
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:5000:5000"
    depends_on:
      - backend
```

- *Backend* is the actual registry.
- *Frontend* is the ambassador that we deployed earlier.
<br/>
It communicates with *backend* using an internal network
and network aliases.

---

## Starting a local registry with Compose

- We will bring up the registry

- Then we will ensure that one *frontend* is running
  on each node by scaling it to our number of nodes

.exercise[

- Make sure that `COMPOSE_FILE` is not set:
  ```bash
  unset COMPOSE_FILE
  ```

- Start the registry:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d
  ```

]

---

## "Scaling" the local registry

- This is a particular kind of scaling

- We just want to ensure that one *frontend*
  is running on every single node of the cluster

.exercise[

- Scale the registry:
  ```bash
    docker-compose scale frontend=5
  ```

]

Note: Swarm might do that automatically for us in the future.

---

## Converting the Compose file for DockerCoins

- Services are no longer at the top level, but under a `services` section

- There has to be a `version` key at the top level, with value `"2"` (as a string, not an integer)

- Links should be removed

- Fixed port mappings should be removed (until [docker/compose#2866](
  https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/2866) is fixed)

- There are other minor differences, but for our sample
  app, that's all we have to worry about!

---

## Our new Compose file

.small[
```yaml
version: '2'

services:
  rng:
    build: rng
    ports:
      - 80

  hasher:
    build: hasher
    ports:
      - 80

  webui:
    build: webui
    ports:
      - 80

  redis:
    image: redis

  worker:
    build: worker
```
]

Copy-paste this into `docker-compose.yml`
<br/>(or you can `cp docker-compose.yml-v2 docker-compose.yml`)

---

## Use images, not builds

- If we try to start the app like that, containers will only
  run on nodes which have the images

- Like before: we need to replace `build` with `image`

- We can re-use the `build-tag-push.py` script for that

.exercise[

- Set `DOCKER_REGISTRY` to use our local registry,
  <br/>then build, tag, and push the application:
  ```bash
  export DOCKER_REGISTRY=localhost:5000
  ../bin/build-tag-push.py
  ```

]

---

## Run the application

- At this point, our app is ready to run

- We don't need ambassadors or extra containers

.exercise[

- Start the application:
  ```bash
  export COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml-`NNN`
  docker-compose up -d
  ```

- Observe that it's running on multiple nodes:
  <br/>(each container name is prefixed with the node it's running on)
  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```

]

---

## View the performance graph

- Load up the graph in the browser

.exercise[

- Check the `webui` service address and port:
  ```bash
  docker-compose port webui 80
  ```

- Open it in your browser

]

---

# Load balancing with overlay networks

- Scaling the `worker` service works out of the box
  (like before)

.exercise[

- Scale `worker`:
  ```bash
  docker-compose scale worker=10
  ```

]

We will hit the bottleneck caused by the `rng` service.

How can we scale that service?

---

## The manual method

- Replace `rng` with:

  - multiple copies `rng1`, `rng2`, `rng3`, ...

  - a load balancer taking over the name `rng`,
    <br/>and spreading traffic accross all instances

- You should have a sense of *d√©j√† vu*

- We did that in the beginning of the workshop

- Can we do better?

---

## The scripted method

- We could write a script to automate those steps

--

- *Can we do better?*

--

- In a perfect world, we would like to do:
  ```bash
  docker-compose scale rng=10
  ```

---

## Naming problem

- Service is called `rng`

- It therefore takes the network name `rng`

- Worker code connects to `rng`

- So `rng` should point to the load balancer

- What do‚ÄΩ

---

## Naming is *per-network*

- Solution: put `rng` on its own network

- That way, it doesn't take the network name `rng`
  <br/>(at least not on the default network)

- Have the load balancer sit on both networks

- Add the name `rng` to the load balancer

---

Load-balanced DockerCoins

![](dockercoins-multi-node.png)

---

## Declaring networks

- Networks (other than the default one)
  *must* be declared
  in a top-level `networks` section,
  placed anywhere in the file

.exercise[

- Add the `rng` network to the Compose file:
  ```yaml
    version: '2'

    networks:
      rng:

    services:
      rng:
        image: ...
    ...
  ```

]

---

## Putting the `rng` service in its network

- Services can have a `networks` section

- If they don't: they are placed in the default network

- If they do: they are placed only in the mentioned networks

.exercise[

- Change the `rng` service to put it in its network:
  ```yaml
    rng:
      image: localhost:5000/dockercoins_rng:‚Ä¶
      networks:
        rng:
  ```

]

---

## Adding the load balancer

- The load balancer has to be in both networks: `rng` and `default`

- In the `default` network, it must have the `rng` alias

- We will use the `jpetazzo/hamba` image

.exercise[

- Add the `rng-lb` service to the Compose file:
  ```yaml
    rng-lb:
      image: jpetazzo/hamba
      command: run
      networks:
        rng:
        default:
          aliases: [ rng ]
  ```
]

---

## Load balancer initial configuration

- We specified `run` as the initial command

- This tells `hamba` to wait for an initial configuration

- The load balancer will not be operational
  <br/>(until we feed it its configuration)

---

## Start the application

.exercise[

- Bring up DockerCoins:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d
  ```

- See that `worker` is complaining:
  ```bash
  docker-compose logs worker
  ```
]

---

## Configure the load balancer

- Multiple solutions:

  - lookup the IP address of the `rng` backend
  - use the backend's network name
  - use the backend's container name (easiest!)

.exercise[

- Configure the load balancer:
  ```bash
    docker run --rm \
      --volumes-from dockercoins_rng-lb_1 \
      --net container:dockercoins_rng-lb_1 \
      jpetazzo/hamba reconfigure 80 dockercoins_rng_1 80
  ```

]

The application should now be working correctly.

---

## Scale the application

- Use `docker-compose scale` as planned

.exercise[

- Scale `rng`:
  ```bash
  docker-compose scale rng=10
  ```

]

Of course, the graph doesn't change *yet*.

We need to add the new backends to the load balancer
configuration first.

---

## Reconfigure the load balancer

- The command is similar to the one before

- We need to pass the list of all backends

.exercise[

- Reconfigure the load balancer:
  ```bash
    docker run --rm \
      --volumes-from dockercoins_rng-lb_1 \
      --net container:dockercoins_rng-lb_1 \
      jpetazzo/hamba reconfigure 80 \
      $(for N in $(seq 1 10); do
          echo dockercoins_rng_$N:80
        done)
  ```

]

---

## Automating the process

- Nobody loves artisan YAML handy craft

- This can be automated very easily

- To make things easier, we can use a label:

  *each container behind a load balancer will
  have a `loadbalancer` label giving the name
  of that loadbalancer*

- See script `reconfigure-load-balancers.py` for an example

---

## Further automation with Engine 1.11 and round robin DNS

- When multiple containers have the same network alias:

  - Engine 1.10 returns only one of them (the same one across the whole network)

  - Engine 1.11 returns all of them (in a random order)

- A "smart" client can use all records to implement load balancing

- See script `add-load-balancer-v2.py` for an example

---

# Going further

Deploying a new version (difficulty: easy)

- Just re-run all the steps!

- However, Compose will re-create the containers

- You will have to re-create ambassadors
  <br/>(and configure them)

- You will have to cleanup old ambassadors
  <br/>(left as an exercise for the reader)

- You will experience a little bit of downtime

## Going further

Zero-downtime deployment (difficulty: medium)

- Isolate stateful services (like we did earlier for Redis) 

- Do blue/green deployment:

  - deploy and scale version N

  - point a "top-level" load balancer to the app

  - deploy and scale version N+1

  - put both apps in the "top-level" balancer

  - slowly switch traffic over to app version N+1

---

## Going further

Harder projects:

- Two-tier or three-tier ambassador deployments

- Deploy to Mesos or Kubernetes

---

## Cleaning up

.exercise[

- Terminate containers and remove them:

  ```bash
  docker-compose down
  ```

]

Note: `docker-compose down` also deletes the
networks that had been created for the application.

# Here be dragons

- So far, we've used stable features

- We're going to explore experimental code

- **Use at your own risk**

---

# Distributing Machine credentials

- All the credentials (TLS keys and certs) are on node1
  <br/>(the node on which we ran `docker-machine create`)

- If we lose node1, we're toast

- We need to move (or copy) the credentials somewhere safe

- Credentials are regular files, and relatively small

- Ah, if only we had a highly available, hierarchic store ...

--

- Wait a minute, we have one!

--

(That's Consul, if you were wondering)

---

## Storing files in Consul

- We will use [Benjamin Wester's consulfs](
  https://github.com/bwester/consulfs)

- It mounts a Consul key/value store as a local filesystem

- Performance will be horrible
  <br/>(don't run a database on top of that!)

- But to store files of a few KB, nobody will notice

- We will copy/link/sync... `~/.docker/machine` to Consul

---

## Installing consulfs

- Option 1: install Go, git clone, go build ...

- Option 2: be lazy and use [jpetazzo/consulfs](
  https://hub.docker.com/r/jpetazzo/consulfs/)

.exercise[

- Be lazy and use the Docker image:
  ```bash
  sudo docker run --rm -v /usr/local/bin:/target jpetazzo/consulfs
  ```
]

Note: the `jpetazzo/consulfs` image contains the
`consulfs` binary.
It copies it to `/target` (if `/target` is a volume).

We need `consulfs` locally (not in a container) because
we can't propagate a FUSE mount from a container to
the host (yet).

---

## Running consulfs

- The `consulfs` binary takes two arguments:

  - the Consul server address
  - a mount point (that has to be created first)

.exercise[

- Create a mount point and mount Consul as a local filesystem:
  ```bash
  mkdir ~/consul
  consulfs localhost:8500 ~/consul
  ```

]

Leave this running in the foreground.

---

## Copying our credentials to Consul

- Use standard UNIX commands

- Don't try to preserve permissions, though (`consulfs` doesn't store permissions)

.exercise[

- Check that Consul key/values are visible:
  ```bash
  ls -l ~/consul/
  ```

- Copy Machine credentials into Consul:
  ```bash
  cp -r ~/.docker/machine/. ~/consul/machine/
  ```

]

(This command can be re-executed to update the copy.)

---

## Mount Consul on another node

- We will repeat the previous steps to mount `~/consul`

.exercise[

- Connect to node2:
  ```bash
  ssh node2
  ```

- Install `consulfs` and mount Consul:
  ```
  sudo docker run --rm -v /usr/local/bin:/target jpetazzo/consulfs
  mkdir ~/consul
  consulfs localhost:8500 ~/consul
  ```

]

At this point, `ls -l ~/consul` should show `docker` and
`machine` directories.

---

## Access the credentials from the other node

- We will create a symlink

- We could also copy the credentials

.exercise[

- Create the symlink:
  ```
  mkdir -p ~/.docker/
  ln -s ~/consul/machine ~/.docker/
  ```

- Check that all nodes are visible:
  ```
  docker-machine ls
  ```

]

.warning[Go back to node1 after this.]

---

## A few words on this strategy

- Anyone accessing Consul can control your Docker cluster
  <br/>(to be fair: anyone accessing Consul can wreck
  serious havoc to your cluster anyway)

- ConsulFS doesn't support *all* POSIX operations,
  <br/>so a few things (like `mv`) will not work)

- As a consequence, with Machine 0.6, you cannot
  run `docker-machine create` directly on top of ConsulFS

---

## What if Consul becomes unavailable?

- If Consul becomes unavailable (e.g. loses quorum),
  <br/>you won't be able to access your credentials

- If Consul becomes unavailable ...
  <br/>your cluster will be in a bad state anyway

- You can still access each Docker Engine over the
  local UNIX socket (and repair Consul that way)


---

# Highly available Swarm managers

- Until now, the Swarm manager was a SPOF
  <br/>(Single Point Of Failure)

- Swarm has support for replication

- When replication is enabled, you deploy multiple (identical) managers

  - one will be "primary"
  - the other(s) will be "secondary"
  - this is determined automatically
    <br/>(through *leader election*)

---

## Swarm leader election

- The leader election mechanism relies on a key/value store
  <br/>(consul, etcd, zookeeper)

- There is no requirement on the number of replicas
  <br/>(the quorum is achieved through the key/value store)

- When the leader (or "primary") is unavailable,
  <br/>a new election happens automatically

- You can issue API requests to any manager:
  <br/>if you talk to a secondary, it forwards to the primary

.warning[There is currently a bug when
the Consul cluster itself has a leader election; see [docker/swarm#1782](
https://github.com/docker/swarm/issues/1782).]

---

## Swarm replication in practice

- We need to give two extra flags to the Swarm manager:

  - `--replication`

    *enables replication (duh!)*

  - `--advertise ip.ad.dr.ess:port`

    *address and port where this Swarm manager is reachable*

- Do you deploy with Docker Machine?
  <br/>Then you can use `--swarm-opt`
  to automatically pass flags to the Swarm manager

---

## Cleaning up our current Swarm containers

- We will use Docker Machine to re-provision Swarm

- We need to:

  - remove the nodes from the Machine registry
  - remove the Swarm containers

.exercise[

- Remove the current configuration:
  ```bash
    for N in 1 2 3 4 5; do
      ssh node$N docker rm -f swarm-agent swarm-agent-master
      docker-machine rm -f node$N
    done
  ```

]

---

## Re-deploy with the new configuration

- This time, all nodes can be deployed identically
  <br/>(instead of 1 manager + 4 non-managers)

.exercise[

```bash
  grep node[12345] /etc/hosts | grep -v ^127 |
  while read IPADDR NODENAME; do
    docker-machine create --driver generic \
      --engine-opt cluster-store=consul://localhost:8500 \
      --engine-opt cluster-advertise=eth0:2376 \
      --swarm --swarm-master \
      --swarm-discovery consul://localhost:8500  \
      --swarm-opt replication --swarm-opt advertise=$IPADDR:3376 \
      --generic-ssh-user docker --generic-ip-address $IPADDR $NODENAME
  done
```

]

.small[
Note: Consul is still running thanks to the `--restart=always` policy.
Other containers are now stopped, because the engines have been
reconfigured and restarted.
]

---

## Assess our new cluster health

- The output of `docker info` will tell us the status
  of the node that we are talking to (primary or replica)

- If we talk to a replica, it will tell us who is the primary

.exercise[

- Talk to a random node, and ask its view of the cluster:
  ```bash
  eval $(docker-machine env node3 --swarm)
  docker info | grep -e ^Name -e ^Role -e ^Primary
  ```

]

Note: `docker info` is one of the only commands that will
work even when there is no elected primary. This helps
debugging.

---

## Test Swarm manager failover

- The previous command told us which node was the primary manager

  - if `Role` is `primary`,
    <br/>then the primary is indicated by `Name`

  - if `Role` is `replica`,
    <br/>then the primary is indicated by `Primary`

.exercise[

- Kill the primary manager:
  ```bash
  ssh node`N` docker kill swarm-agent-master
  ```

]

Look at the output of `docker info` every few seconds.

---

# Highly available containers

- Swarm has support for *rescheduling* on node failure

- It has to be explicitly enabled on a per-container basis

- When the primary manager detects that a node goes down,
  <br/>those containers are rescheduled elsewhere

- If the containers can't be rescheduled (constraints issue),
  <br/>they are lost (there is no reconciliation loop yet)

- In Swarm 1.1, this is an *experimental* feature
  <br/>(To enable it, you must pass the `--experimental` flag when you start Swarm itself!)

- In Swarm 1.2, you don't need the `--experimental` flag anymore

---

## About Swarm generic flags

- Some flags like `--experimental` and `--debug` must be *before* the Swarm command
  <br/>(i.e. `docker run swarm --debug manage ...`)

- We cannot use Docker Machine to pass that flag ‚òπ
  <br/>(Machine adds flags *after* the Swarm command)

- Instead, we can use a custom Swarm image:
  ```dockerfile
  FROM swarm
  ENTRYPOINT ["/swarm", "--debug"]
  ```

- We can tell Machine to use this with `--swarm-image`

---

## Start a resilient container

- By default, containers will not be restarted when their node goes down

- You must pass an explicit *rescheduling policy* to make that happen

- For now, the only policy is "on-node-failure"

.exercise[

- Start a container with a rescheduling policy:

  ```bash
  CID=$(docker run -d -e reschedule:on-node-failure nginx)
  ```

]

Check that the container is up and running.

---

## Simulate a node failure

- We will reboot the node running this container

- Swarm will reschedule it

.exercise[

- Check on which node the container is running:
  </br>`NODE=$(docker inspect --format '{{.Node.Name}}' $CID)`

- Reboot that node:
  <br/>`ssh $NODE sudo reboot`

- Check that the container has been recheduled:
  <br/>`docker ps -a`

]

---

## Reboots

- When rebooting a node, Docker is stopped cleanly, and containers are stopped

- Our container is rescheduled, but not started

- To simulate a "proper" failure, we can use the Chaos Monkey script instead

```bash
~/orchestration-workshop/bin/chaosmonkey $NODE <connect|disconnect|reboot>
```

---

## .warning[Caveats]

- There are some corner cases when the node is also
  the Swarm leader or the Consul leader; this is being improved
  right now!

- The safest way to address for now this is to run the Consul
  servers, the Swarm managers, and your containers, on
  different nodes.

- Swarm doesn't handle gracefully the fact that after the
  reboot, you have *two* containers named `highlander`,
  and attempts to manipulate the container with its name
  will not work. This will be improved too.

---

# Conclusions

- Bad news: we still have work to do to deploy our apps

  - it's not all unicorns, ponies, and rainbows

  - *no, Docker will not make your job obsolete*

- Good news: a lot of hard things are becoming easier

  - building, packaging, distributing apps

  - running distributed systems on clusters

---

## "This is complicated"

- The scripts used here are pretty simple (each is less than 100 LOCs)

- You can easily rewrite them in your favorite language,
  <br/>adapt and customize them, in a few hours of time

- FYI: those scripts are smaller and simpler than the
  scripts (cloud init etc) used to deploy the VMs for this
  workshop!

- Docker Inc. has commercial products to wrap all this:

  - Docker Cloud
    <br/>(manage your Docker nodes from a SAAS portal)

  - Docker Datacenter
    <br/>(buzzword-compliant management solution:
    <br/>turnkey, enterprise-class, on-premise, etc.)

---

## What's next?

- November 2015: Compose 1.5 + Engine 1.9 =
  <br/>first release with multi-host networking

- January 2016: Compose 1.6 + Engine 1.10 =
  <br/>embedded DNS server, experimental high availability

- April 2016: Compose 1.7 + Engine 1.11 =
  <br/>round robin DNS records, huge improvements in HA

- Next release: another truckload of features

- I will deliver this workshop about twice a month

- Check out the GitHub repo for updated content!
  <br/>(there is a tag for each big round of updates)
